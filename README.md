# Daily Bread 📖✨

## What is Daily Bread? 🤔
After being a long-time user of Duolingo, I became inspired to create a Bible memorization app that I could use the learn some of my favorite scripture better! Daily Bread is a full-blown Progressive Web Application that utilizes user creation and authentication, storage of user data with a agile backend, and implements proven memorization strategies all while adding a game-like feel to the application. This application took me roughly 200-250 hours to get it to where it is. This included learning a lot about React, TypeScript/JavaScript, databases, Rest APIs, and much more. Overall, I am extremely proud of where it is and many of my friends and family use it in it's current state.
